# Game Rules

## Xs and Os

The game is played on a grid that is 3 squares by 3 squares. One player is randomly selected as X and the other is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Line Four

Line Four is a game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.

## Spy Hunt

In Spy Hunt, there are two teams: the spy the detectives. In a span of 8 minutes, each player is given a location and role except the spy. Through multiple rounds of questioning, the detectives will try to figure out who the spy is and the spy will attempt to guess the location through inference.

## Password
Two teams have an elected clue giver and each team has turns guessing based on a clue given by the selected individual. The clue givers from both teams know the chosen word. The clues should be vague but not too obvious to the point where it can be easily guessed. The team to guess the word first wins!

## Shades and Tones
First, a “cue giver” hides a specific color they’ve chosen out of a deck of cards. There are 480 shades on the board in front of you! After getting one- and two-word cues, everyone places their marker on which color they think is being described. “Coffee.” Is it dark brown, as in freshly brewed? “Au lait.” With milk. That means I should pick a lighter shade!

## Where Wolf?

Mafia, also known as Werewolf, is a social deduction game that pits two groups against each other: the informed minority (the Mafia or Werewolves) and the uninformed majority (the Villagers). Players are secretly assigned roles as either a member of the Mafia, a Villager, or a special character such as the Doctor or Sheriff. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Mafia covertly chooses a Villager to eliminate, while special characters use their abilities to protect or investigate others. During the day, all players debate the identities of the Mafia and vote to eliminate a suspect they believe is a Mafia member. The game ends when all Mafia members are eliminated or the Mafia equals or outnumbers the Villagers. Strategy, persuasion, and deceit are key elements, as players use their roles and information to influence others and protect their identities.
